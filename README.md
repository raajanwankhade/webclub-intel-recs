# Intelligence SIG Recruitments 2023 TASK 2

We're thrilled to have you work on our exciting second task where curiosity meets intelligence. You're set to embark on an adventure of data exploration, innovation, and collaboration in this task. We hope this task will be a valuable learning experience for you, allowing you to explore the fascinating world of Machine Learning. Your unique perspective and ideas are highly valued, and we encourage you to engage, ask questions, and seek guidance. Get ready to dive into the world of Intelligence, and let's learn and grow together. Best wishes as you embark on this journey! ðŸŒŸðŸ’»

We hope you enjoyed Task 1 on Kaggle! Task 2 is a polyphasic task. This means that there are multiple phases to the overall task:
* **Task 2A** - Creating Word Embeddings
* **Task 2B** - Performing Machine Translation
* **Task 2C** - Doing QnA
* **Task 2D** - Designing your own ML system

There are specific instructions given for each task, present in the `Polyphasic` folder, please go through the same. We expect you to go through the tasks in order, so that you can build up to the final Task 2D. Read each task clearly, and go through the given resources to formulate a better understanding of the problem statement. In case of any further doubts, you can ask questions on the group. We also expect you all to google all your technical doubts and explore each task deeply, with a balance of theory and implementation. Do not wait last minute to start this task.

## Instructions
* Clone this repository and make your repository **PRIVATE**.
* Add `csking101`, `harry7337`, `miniMaddy`, `IWNMWE`, `MeherRushi`, `HridayM25` as collaborators
* For every notebook that you make, you need to ensure that you upload the same in the respective folder(pertaining to the task), if you want you can create multiple files for different methods used.
* For tasks where you have to generate data, make sure you are keeping them in different folders, and are referencing them from the Jupyter notebooks. (For example, if you are making embeddings with TF-IDF and BOW, keep the embeddings in a `Embeddings_TF-IDF` folder and `Embeddings_BOW` folder respectively.
* If you are facing any issues, feel free to ask on the Recruitments group or message any senior in the group.
