    "# Embeddings\n",
    "Word embeddings are numerical representations of words in a high-dimensional vector space that capture semantic relationships and contextual information. These embeddings are essential in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, enabling computers to understand and process textual data more effectively. One common method to create word embeddings is Word2Vec, which utilizes neural networks to map words to dense vectors in such a way that similar words are close together in the vector space. Another popular approach is the use of pre-trained embeddings like Word2Vec, GloVe, or FastText, which are learned on large text corpora and can be fine-tuned for specific NLP tasks. Additionally, TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) can be used to create embeddings by representing the importance of words in documents relative to a corpus. These embeddings are valuable for various NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis, text classification, machine translation, and more, as they provide a compact and meaningful representation of words that captures their semantic properties."
